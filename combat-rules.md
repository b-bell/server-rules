1: Claiming a Body: If you attack and kill a player as an attacker, you automatically claim the body (unless you're an herbivores). You and your group may claim only one body at a time. Your entire group must stay with the body until it disappears or becomes gore/ribs.
 You may allow other dinosaurs to eat from the body. 

 < You may leave to get water or to fill a nearby nest but you must return as soon as possible; take turns leaving if you have a group. >

 You may be hunted while you are away from the body, and your group/pack cannot abandon the body to help you.
    * If you are hunted while away from the body but manage to return, the hunt is over and the attackers must either contest for the body or leave.

 < Do not create a nest just to get rid of a body faster. >

 If you are not in combat and eat from an unclaimed body, you claim that body.

 < Dinos that are not sharing or contesting a body must stay clear of dinos that have claimed a body. >
    * If an uninvited dino comes within eating range of the body, it has initiated a contest and the owner may then act accordingly and attack the uninvited dino without 3 calling.

 No small dino tossing 
    * This means you cannot toss a small dino into a fight in an attempt to get a quick defender body down and end combat. If a small dino runs into a fight and dies they are not considered bodies down, however if any of these are specifically hunted and targeted then they will count as a body down.
What counts as a small dino:
Herrera
Austros
Gallies
Dryos
Hatchlings
Juvies
AI Players

2: Hunting: Carnivores may hunt other dinos, since that is their source of food. They are not required to declare their intent to attack. Herbivores cannot hunt. Once a hunt is over, the two parties may not target each other for the next 20 minutes (even after the body is gone). This means you may not follow/stalk, attack, or contest a body from any group or dino until the 20 minute timer has run out.

 Once a defender or an adult apex (from either party) dies, the hunt is over and the attackers automatically take claim of the body. Any remaining defenders must leave the area immediately or once bleeding stops(unless contesting for the body).
    * If the defenders have had a nest down in the area for 5 mins or more (prior to any combat) then they are not required to leave the area but MUST keep their distance from the attackers.

 If the defenders are carnivores:
    * They may contest for the body within 30 seconds of the initial body drop; or
    * They may claim an unclaimed body in the area (such as a dead attacker) and then must leave. 

 < If the attackers claim an unclaimed body mid-fight, the hunt is over. The attackers must leave after the body disappears or becomes gore/ribs. If the defenders are carnivores, they may contest for the body. >

 If the attackers 4-call to surrender and the defenders 2-call to accept, then the hunt is over and the attackers must leave the area immediately or once bleeding stops.
    * If the defenders are carnivores, they may claim an unclaimed body in the area. The attackers may not contest this claim.
    * The attackers may claim an unclaimed body in the area and then must leave.
    * Defenders are not required to accept surrender from the attackers.

 Hatchlings do not count as bodies unless the attackers express they wish to claim it or the attackers specifically target the hatchling to kill it.

 < You may not hunt juvies on the beach. Even if you are a juvi. >
    * If you are hunted as a juvie while away from the beach, running back to it will not protect you.
    * If you attack an adult or subadult dino on the beach as a juvi you are forfeiting your beach protection.
    * If you eat from another player or groups body without permission on the beach you forfeit your beach protection.


 You may not hunt if you or your group has a body claimed.

 < You may not hunt a dino that is with a body it has claimed. >
    * Dinos away from the body may be hunted.
    * Dinos with a body must be challenged to contest for the body.

3: Contesting for a Body: Carnivores may challenge other dinos for bodies they have claimed. To initiate a contest, the challenger must 3-call at the owner and then wait for a response. Once the contest is over, the two parties may not target each other for the next 20 minutes (even after the body is gone).
 If the owner 3-calls, then the challenge has been accepted.
    * The two parties fight until the first body down, then the contest is over. The winner gets first pick at a body. The loser must claim the remaining body and then leave.
    * If either party 4-calls to surrender and the other party 2-calls to accept, the contest is over and the loser must leave immediately or once bleeding stops. Neither party is required to accept a surrender and may keep fighting even if a 4-call is made.

 < If the owner 4-calls, then the body is surrendered to the challenger and the contest is over. The owner must leave immediately or once bleeding stops. >

 If the owner 2-calls, they wish to share the body with the challenger.
    * If the challenger 2-calls, the contest is over and they may eat the body.
    * If the challenger 3-calls, the owner must either 3-call to accept the challenge or 4-call to surrender the body.

 < If the owner does not respond after three 3-calls, the challenger may attack as though the owner had accepted the challenge. If the owner refuses to respond and instead chooses to eat from the body, that will be considered an acceptance of the contest and may be attacked (even if only one 3-call has been made). >

 If an uninvited dino comes within eating range of the body, it has initiated a contest and the owner may then act accordingly and attack the uninvited dino without 3 calling.

  No Body Camping
    * If a player has a claimed body, you cannot wait for the body to depsawn or turn to gore and attack them. You must either contest for the body or leave the area. 

 < If the body despawns in mid 3-call of a contest or during a contest you treat the scenario as a body contest. >

 4: Herbivores cannot hunt, contest for bodies, or guard bodies (preventing carnivores from getting to them).

 Herbivores may act aggressively or even initiate combat (as attackers) against unwanted dinos that are close to their nests and their young but must 3-call before initiating combat.
     * Fight ends when a defender or an adult apex body (from either party) dies. Any remaining defenders must leave the area immediately or once bleeding stops.
     * If the herbivores were the attackers then the body is considered unclaimed and may be claimed by any carnivores that wish to claim it. 
     * As attackers, herbivores cannot chase for longer than 15 seconds if none of the targets have bitten or attacked a member of the herd. 
     * Herbivores may not use nests as a means to get around the no hunting rule. Any Herbivore seen quickly laying down a nest and using it as an excuse to 3-call and attack a dino unprovoked will be considered hunting and dealt with accordingly. 
 Herbivores may fight (as defenders) in response to being hunted or threatened.
    * Examples of threatening behavior includes biting, following, crouching, and 3-calling.
    * Herbivores do not have to wait to be attacked or bitten before defending themselves. This means once threatened herbivores may attack (as defenders) without needing to 3-call first. 
    * If the attackers are carnivores and they claim an unclaimed body mid-fight then their hunt is over and fighting must stop. 

< Herbivores may give chase to kill a dino that has attacked or threatened them or members of their herd. If the herbivore or its pack members have not been threatened or attacked they may only chase for up to 15 seconds. >

  

 Once fighting stops, the two parties may not target each other for the next 20 minutes (even after the body is gone).
