  We will not accept any reports made 24 hours after an incident has occurred. A report must be made within 24 hours of the incident occurring. 

  Staff can only issue out a strike after sufficient evidence of a rule break has been presented or if they have witnessed the rule break in full, firsthand, and with proper context. A 3rd party recording is required to verify any calls being made. Without verification of calls the evidence may not be sufficient enough to issue out a strike, regrow, heal, or body drop. 

  Staff are not required to issue out any regrows, heals, or body drops if sufficient evidence of a rule break cannot be presented but may do so if they think it is warranted and have good reason to do so.

  If you are caught fabricating evidence or witholding vital information in an attempt to wrongfully report a player, You will be given a strike for making a false report.

   Attacking a group/player 3 or more times is considered targeting.

15: Kicking Out a Group Member: A group may remove a dino from their group by warning them in chat and 3-calling them.
 If the dinos that are kicked out refuse to leave or 3-call back, the two parties may fight until the first body down or one side 4-calls to surrender and the surrender is accepted with a 2-call (surrenders are not required to be accepted). The losers must leave immediately or once bleeding stops. Both parties then have a 20 min combat timer between them.
 
16: No Egg Hopping: Accepting an egg invite and then accepting another egg from someone else within 15 minutes of the first egg will result in a warning/strike.
