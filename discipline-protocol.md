 A player will receive one strike per incident.
 
   Staff reserve the right to strike and punish players in any manner deemed necessary and/or fitting for the violation that has occurred and punishment(s) may be increased to match the severity of the offense.   
  * For example, a player on strike 2 might get banned for 24 hours instead of 12 hour.                                                
  * Blatant disregard for rules may result in an indefinite ban on the first strike

 Admins may act immediately on incidents they witness in full, firsthand, and with proper context.

 Admin will not interfere in on-going rule break situations they have not witnessed in full, firsthand, and with proper context.

 If your steam ID is not registerd with your discord at the time of you recieving a strike, We are not responsible for you not being informed about the strike. Staff use steam IDs to locate and contact players.

 Please have evidence such as screenshots, screen recordings, or The Isleâ€™s auto recording to show the rule being broken and the context in which it occurs.

 Staff do not resolve reports through private messages.
